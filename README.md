# Chest-X-Ray-Image_Classification
## Business Case
A hospital reach out to a team of data scientists to create a learning model that would look at chest X-ray to predict whether or not the patient has pneumonia.
Given the dataset from Kaggle, the team are expected to:
..*Create an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
..*High accuracy
